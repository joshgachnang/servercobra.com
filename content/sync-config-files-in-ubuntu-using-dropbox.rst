Dropbox is a fantastically amazing program to keep documents synced and
backed up across computers. It also works wonders for syncing config
files! I'm going to show you how to sync your ~/.bashrc file between
computers. Â I use this one to add a bunch of aliases and other things to
make my command line life a bit easier.

First grab the `Dropbox Ubuntu Installer (32 bit)`_ or the `Dropbox
Ubuntu Installer (64 bit)`_. You can also head over to the `Dropbox
download page`_ if the links get stale or outdated. Double click the
installer, and it will open the Ubuntu Software Center. Simply hit
Install, and it will complete most of the process for you.

The GUI installer will create a folder called ~/Dropbox. Then go to the
terminal again.

We are first going to make a new folder in Dropbox called config. Then
we are going to move our bashrc file into it, then make a symbolic link
where the file used to be.

.. code-block:: bash

	cd ~/Dropbox
	mkdir config
	mv ~/.bashrc ~/Dropbox/config
	ln -s ~/Drobox/config/.bashrc ~/.bashrc



Now personally, I don't want to have to do this on each computer I am
syncing, so in a very SysAdmin style, let's script it.

.. code-block:: bash

	mkdir ~/Dropbox/scripts
	nano ~/Dropbox/scripts/sync\_config.sh
	mv ~/.bashrc ~/Dropbox/config/bashrc
	ln -s ~/Dropbox/config/bashrc ~/.bashrc

#!/bin/bash

| #Repeat for each config file you want synced
	rm ~/.bashrc
	ln -s ~/Dropbox/config/bashrc ~/.bashrc



Now whenever you get a new computer that needs the config files synced,
simply install Dropbox, then run the script:

.. code-block:: bash

	sh ~/Dropbox/scripts/sync\_config.sh

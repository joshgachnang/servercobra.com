Recently, DiveIntoPython.org was taken down. It is was a site/book
written by Mark Pilgrim to help you learn Python. It is how I taught
myself Python, and still a very valuable resource that I go back to time
and time again. Unfortunately, Mark has taken down all of his sites on
the Internet, with no notice/explanation. Â Luckily, he has provided all
of his sites under open licenses, allowing and encouraging people to
mirror them. I bought `DiveIntoPython.net`_, and found an old copy of
his site, and put it up. Unfortunately, it is not complete: it is still
missing some of the downloads and all of the translations. If you have
copies of the files or the translations, please leave a comment or
`email me`_.

Likewise, I have also mirrored DiveIntoPython3 at `DiveIntoPython3.net`_
and DiveIntoHTML5 at `DiveIntoHTML5.net`_.

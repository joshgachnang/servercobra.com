I haven't been posting in a little bit, because I've had a few side
projects dragging me away (and finals to study for..).  However, now
that finals are over, and I have a month off from classes, I have a new
project which will be putting a ton of new posts on the site, so check
back soon!

One of my side projects that I just released today publicly is
`MyLifeIsGeek.com`_. It is a small site I developed using Python and
Django. The framework to build sites like this is also being released as
open source under the BSD license. I am migrating the site to first use
`Google Storage for Developers`_ to serve up all the static content,
template files, and as much as possible, then fully migrating the whole
Django project over to `Google App Engine`_.  The project will be made
into a multi-tenant project, allowing other users to create their own
sites for free. Take a look!

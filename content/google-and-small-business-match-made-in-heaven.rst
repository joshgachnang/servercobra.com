Does anyone start small businesses anymore without a web presence?
Once you have a web presence, most of your traffic will probably come
from one company, Google.  So why not build you business up with the
tools they provide? So here are the top applications that Google
provides that will help you get your business up and running.
`1. Google Apps`_
Google Apps is one the most useful collection of tools you can find
on the web for a small business.  It provides Gmail with email addresses
ending in your domain name, like \ Josh@DOMAINNAME.com. It also provides
access to Google Docs, an online office suite similar to Microsoft
Office, except in your browser.  I am almost obsessive about keeping my
life organized, so the combination of Google Calendar and Google Mobile
help keep me sane and on time.  Google Calendar provides you a private
calendar that can be shared among all your co-workers to organize
meetings and tasks.  Google Mobile brings all these features to your
mobile phone, and works especially well if you have an iPhone,
Blackberry Palm Pre, or Android-powered phone.  For your organization,
you can also get Chat, a Wiki-like Sites feature, a webpage builder, and
a contact organizer.  If you sell any product, you should be using
SalesForce.com, which conveniently integrates with Google Apps. 
Overall, these tools should cover many of the needs your business will
have, and all of it for free. We’ll be going over some of these products
more in depth in the next article.

If you don’t already have a domain name, Google can register one for you
and get you started right away during the signup process.  Some domain
registrars and hosting providers, like \ `Dreamhost`_\ provide a single
button to click and get started. Once you are registered and verified,
visit your site by going to\ http://google.com/a/YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME,
login, and start using this magical software.  It is free for up to 100
users, the perfect size for most small businesses.

`2. Google Alerts`_
Google Alerts is often an understated and overlooked tool that is
invaluable to any small business.  Simply visit the site and type in
your competitors’ names, your product, or keywords about your product.
Then choose how often you want to be notified, and wait for the emails
to start rolling in.  Alerts will keep you up-to-date as your
competitors make announcements, roll out new products, or rumors start
surfacing, so that you can stay competitive.

`3. Google Maps/Local Business Center`_
If you have a brick-and-mortar store, you have no excuse to not be
listed on Google Maps.  Being listed there makes you available on
multiple channels, such as Goog-411, Google Maps, Maps for Mobile, and
more.  It gives you complete control over your listing, from hours open
to type of shop to reviews from customers.  It even provides you a way
to give your customers a coupon if they find your store through Maps. 
Not only does this make your customers more likely to come in, but it
gives you a great way to track how tech-savvy your customers are finding
your store.

`4. Google Product Search`_
Do you sell a product? Is it listed on Google Product Search yet? If
not, why not? Google Product Search provides a way for you to sell your
product through Google’s expansive search engine.  Products from Product
Search can show up in normal Google search’s if they are relevant.  It
is free to list your products using a data feed, which Google will
conveniently help you set up.  Product Search can increase traffic to
your own commerce site or you can use Google Checkout, and combined with
Adwords, it is a perfect end-to-end marketing campaign.  Adwords will be
covered in the next article.

`5. Google Adsense`_
Google Adsense is a way to monetize on your site or blog.  It gives
you a multitude of options of what kind of ads to show, how to show ads,
and where to show them. Ads can be small text banners to giant image
banners, with the larger ones making more money.  You can choose to
filter out competitors’ ads, the colors of the ads, and where they are
placed.  Google provides great tracking for impressions and clicks,
along with watching how much money you are making.  You can provide ads
right on your page, RSS feeds, custom Google searches, and even high-end
mobile phones.  While Adsense won’t make you rich, it can definitely pay
the bills for most hosting bills on a decent traffic site.  This should
allow you to provide more free content, because more free content means
more traffic, and traffic translates into dollars in your pocket.

Those are five of the most useful tools Google provides.  My next
article will go over some of the Google Apps tools and great ways to use
them to make your business better.  I will also cover Google Adwords,
which allows you to use Google’s massive network of ad displays to show
off your product for a small fee. Google Adwords helps you manage your
brand image, and Google Analytics, the final piece of software for the
next post, will help you track how your brand is doing overall.

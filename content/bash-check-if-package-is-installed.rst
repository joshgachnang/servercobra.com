**Platform(s)**: Ubuntu (probably Debian too)
Sometimes you need to take an action based on whether or not a
particular package (first argument) is installed or not. This script
checks if the package is installed, then takes action based on that. If
it's not installed, the script exits.

**Update:**\ As Reef pointed out in the comments, if you are searching
for a package name with grep, you could get other packages. The example
given was checking if the package "zip" is installed, which may not, but
packages like "bzip" are, you'll get a false positive. Rather, he
provided code which uses the exit status code of dpkg to determine
success or failure. Specifically, if dpkg doe have a package by that
name, it will return 0. If it does not, it will return 1. We can check
the exit status code with "$?". Therefore, the improved code is:

.. code-block:: bash

	#!/bin/bash
	dpkg -l $1 >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo -n “not ” ; echo “installed”

    # Alternatively, in a much longer, and more roundabout fashion:
	dpkg -l $1 > /dev/null 2>&1
	INSTALLED=$?

    if [ $INSTALLED == '0' ]; then
	    echo "installed"
	else
	    echo "not installed"
	fi


.. code-block:: bash

	#!/bin/bash
	INSTALLED=$(dpkg -l \grep $1)
	if [ "$INSTALLED" != "" ]; then
	    echo "installed"
	else
	    echo "not installed"
	    exit
	fi



Run the command like this:

.. code-block:: bash

	bash your-script-name.sh package

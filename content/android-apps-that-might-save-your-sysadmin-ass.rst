I posted a while ago that since I got my Evo, `it has changed my daily
workflow`_. I quickly realized a lot of the stuff I do with my servers
can easily be done through my phone just as quickly.  These are my
favorite apps to make dealing with my servers easier. If you have your
own favorite apps, or suggestions, leave them in the comments!

`ConnectBot`_, Free
-------------------

It's happened to all of us at one point or another. Some critical server
goes down while you are at dinner or at a family function with no laptop
at hand. What do you do!? ConnectBot is a great answer for running a few
commands on a remote server though SSH. It has most of the features you
could want for SSH on your phone: public keys, storing hosts, multiple
sessions, using ports other than 22 for SSH, multiple terminal
emulations, etc. It is the perfect tool when you just need to run a few
quick commands. I wouldn't recommend digging through complex problems,
but it is great for quick fixes. If you are running the same commands
often, then the next app will make life even easier.

`Server Assistant`_, Free
-------------------------

Server Assistant is a great app for saving and running server macros. On
the surface, it has a few great tools, like getting the status and load
of a server, automatically launching a ConnectBot instance, but it's
really a coin toss whether to use this or ConnectBot. The real benefit
of this app is the ability to save commands, and run them with a single
click.  I like to keep around restart commands for the daemons I'm
running, and a few app-specific commands (Wordpress, Django, etc). This
can really be a lifesaver when you get a message that your web server
mysteriously crashed while you're at the theater. Only problem I can see
is no way to use public keys.

`Pingdom`_, Free (More than 1 host, $9.95/mo)
---------------------------------------------

I originally signed up for Pingdom just to keep an eye on a server that
was in active development. Since then, it has become a valuable tool,
and every site that is important to me is monitored. The Pingdom Android
app makes this whole process even easier. All you have to do is log in,
choose the site you want stats on, and you'll get an uptime report,
downtime, and average latency. Also, Pingdom will email you (and
optionally text you) whenever your server is detected to be down. The
text messages aren't all that useful (and cost money) if you have
Pingdom email your Gmail account (which pushes automagically and quickly
to your phone). Eventually you will probably will be so happy with the
app, that you'll want to upgrade you raccount, so you can keep tabs on
all your sites. Additional sites are only $0.50 each per month, above
the $10 a month, which isn't too expensive. I'd rather get the alert
right away, rather than waiting for a customer or reader to try and
email me.

Other Apps
----------

These are some apps that may interest you, though I don't use them
personally, so I can't give much feedback.

FTP/SCP
~~~~~~~

-  `AndFTP`_ (Client, FTP, SCP)
-  `SwiFTP`_ (Server)
-  `DroidSCP`_\ (SCP Client)

Remote Desktop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Wyse PocketCloud`_ (Free/$15)
-  `Android-VNC-Viewer`_

Hopefully these apps make your life easier! Add a comment if you have
another app that might make our lives easier!

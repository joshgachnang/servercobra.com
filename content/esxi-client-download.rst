If youâ€™re like me, you install ESXi on anything possible. Sometimes, I
have them installed remotely, and with how often I reinstall Windows, I
sometimes don't have the client installed. If you really want to get it
on your own, you need to extract a bunch of files off the CD, or figure
out how to get it off the server remotely (port forwarding, etc etc). Or
you could just download it here:

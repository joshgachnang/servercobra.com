Sometimes, shit happens. If you're reading this, it probably just
happened. Either you forgot your password or somehow you set it to
something else through a script, or something else equally terrible
happened. Regardless, you need to reset your password. First, you should
probably make a backup of your data in case something goes horribly
wrong. This should work on almost any version of Ubuntu (or other
versions of Linux), but it is tested on Ubuntu 10.04 with mysql-server
5.1.

First, we need to shut down MySQL. This is going to bring all your
database-driven sites down (though caching may save you). Then we will
restart it, while ignoring the permissions table.

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo stop mysql
	sudo mysqld --skip-grant-tables &
	# Note the PID that is printed out, such as "[1] 14053", where "14053" is the PID.



Now we log in with no password, and reset the password.

.. code-block:: bash

	mysql -u root
	UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('YOURNEWPASSWORD') WHERE User='root'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; exit;



The password is reset! Now we need to kill off the passwordless
instance, and restart a normal MySQL server.

.. code-block:: bash

	# PID is the number from before, probably 4 or 5 digits
	sudo kill PID
	sudo start mysql



Now make sure you can log in!

.. code-block:: bash

	mysql -u root -p YOURNEWPASSWORD

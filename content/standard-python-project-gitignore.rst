I write a lot of Python projects and store them all in Git version
control. Each time, I find myself rewriting the .gitignore file, so my
repositories aren't cluttered with .pyc files, temporary files, files
from pip/virtualenv, and others. So here is my current base .gitignore,
partly so it can help you, the reader, and partly so I know where it is.
I'll update it as I find other troublesome files. What do your
.gitignores look like?

.. code-block:: bash

	# Python compiled files
	\*.py[co1]

| # Packages
	\*.egg
	\*.egg-info
	dist
	build
	eggs
	parts
	bin
	var
	sdist
	develop-eggs
	.installed.cfg

| # Installer logs
	pip-log.txt

| # Unit test / coverage reports
	.coverage
	.tox

| #Translations
	\*.mo

| #Mr Developer
	.mr.developer.cfg

| # Logging
	\*output.log

| #Kate editor
	\*kate-swp\*

| #Ubuntu One (if also stored for syncing)
	\*u1conflict\*

| #Mercurial
	\*/.hg/

| #Additional editor
	\*~
	\*.save

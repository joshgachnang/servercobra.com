I love the Ubuntu terminal. I spend more time in it than any sane person
should. So obviously, I customize it as much as possible to make it work
exactly how I want. The easiest way I've found is through aliases. An
example of an alias is when I type "update" into my terminal, the real
command it runs is "sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade"
(Automagically updates and upgrades all the packages on my system).
While searching for other fun shortcuts, I came across `this helpful
post`_. It provides a quick way to install aliases into your system.
I've modified it to make it a bit better (I think). All credit for the
idea still goes to Brock Angelo, the original author.

Fire up your favorite editor, and save this file either in you home
directory (/home/username/aliasgen.sh) or I prefer to save it into
/bin/aliasgen (requires sudo) so all users can access it. We'll set up a
handy alias for it also, so it doesn't really matter. Here's the
modified code for the script:

.. code-block:: bash

	#!/bin/bash
	echo Enter the shortcut, or alias, you want to use:
	read SHORTTEXT
	echo Now enter what text you want it to replace:
	read LONGTEXT
	echo "alias $SHORTTEXT='$LONGTEXT'" >> ~/.bash\_aliases
	echo "Alias $SHORTTEXT='$LONGTEXT' Type 'bash' for changes to take effect."



The main change I made was adding the text to ~/.bash\_aliases instead
of the main ~/.bashrc. My ~/.bashrc has other customizations (which I'll
get to in a future post), and the standard Ubuntu bashrc already has
support for this file to keep everything organized. Also, I added the
handy point at the end, that you only need to type 'bash' into each
terminal you have open currently for it to take immediate effect (I
don't log out for months at a time).

Anyways, let's alias this! An alias for a program to make aliases to
another program is getting a bit Inception-like, but oh well. Our alias
will run the program, then immediately restart the terminal so changes
take effect immediately. Head to the terminal and run the program:

.. code-block:: bash

	#If you saved it in /bin, first change permissions (first time only), then run it
	sudo chmod 755 /bin/aliasgen
	/bin/aliasgen

    #Or in your home directory
	./aliasgen.sh

    #We can't use 'alias', as that is a Linux command, which we can't override
	#Instead input something like:
	al
	#Then
	/bin/aliasgen; bash;
	#Or, if you saved it in your home directory
	bash ~/aliasgen.sh; bash;



That should about cover it! Run it an see how you like it!
